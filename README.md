## Features

### Loudness & Dynamics
- **Input Gain** - Adjust input level before processing (-12dB to +12dB)
- **Loudness Normalization** - Automatically adjusts to Spotify's -14 LUFS standard
- **True Peak Limiting** - Prevents clipping with adjustable ceiling (-3dB to 0dB)
- **Glue Compression** - Light compression to glue the mix together and add punch

### EQ & Tonal
- **5-Band Parametric EQ** - Fine-tune frequencies (80Hz, 250Hz, 1kHz, 4kHz, 12kHz)
- **EQ Presets** - Flat, Vocal Boost, Bass Boost, Bright, Warm, Suno Fix
- **Cut Mud** - Reduce muddy frequencies around 250Hz
- **Add Air** - Sparkle and brightness with 12kHz high shelf boost
- **Tame Harshness** - Reduce harsh frequencies around 4-6kHz

### Low End
- **Clean Low End** - Removes sub-bass rumble below 30Hz

### Stereo
- **Stereo Width** - Adjustable stereo image (0% mono to 200% extra wide) with real-time preview
- **Mono Bass** - Narrows bass below 80Hz for better club/speaker compatibility

### Output
- **Waveform Display** - Visual waveform with click-to-seek functionality
- **Level Meter** - Real-time stereo peak metering with peak hold and overload indicator
- **Real-time Preview** - Hear EQ and effect changes before exporting
- **FX Bypass** - Toggle all effects to compare before/after
- **Streaming Preset** - 44.1kHz/16-bit (Spotify, Apple Music, CD quality)

## Changelog

### v1.3.1 (2026-01-17)

**UI Overhaul**
- Redesigned layout from sidebar to horizontal header for better use of space
- Added WaveSurfer.js waveform visualization with click-to-seek functionality
- Replaced sliders with vertical faders for Input Gain, Ceiling, and 5-band EQ
- Updated transport controls (Play, Stop, Bypass) with SVG icons
- "Live" badges now hidden until audio is loaded

**New Features**
- Input Gain fader - adjust input level before processing (-12dB to +12dB)
- Ceiling fader - precise true peak ceiling control (-3dB to 0dB)
- Window auto-resizes to optimal size (1050x910) when audio loads
- Toast notifications with 5-second auto-dismiss

**Export Improvements**
- Export now shows modal with progress bar (same style as file loading)
- Cancel button available in export modal
- Better progress feedback during rendering

**UI Polish**
- Consistent fader heights across Loudness and EQ sections
- Improved spacing between waveform and level meter
- Added visual separator between EQ faders and presets

### v1.3.0 (2026-01-17)

**Removed FFmpeg Dependency**
- Completely removed FFmpeg.wasm - app now uses pure JavaScript for all audio processing
- Faster file loading (no WASM initialization delay)
- Smaller app bundle size
- No more cross-origin isolation requirements

**Pure JavaScript LUFS Measurement**
- Implemented ITU-R BS.1770-4 compliant loudness measurement
- K-weighting filters (high shelf + high pass) for perceptual loudness
- 400ms blocks with 75% overlap for accurate integrated loudness
- Absolute threshold (-70 LUFS) and relative threshold (-10 LU) gating

**Web Audio Offline Render**
- Export now uses OfflineAudioContext for guaranteed identical output to preview
- Same processing chain for preview and export (no more "thin and loud" exports)
- Pure JavaScript WAV encoder supporting 16-bit and 24-bit
- Sample rate conversion handled by Web Audio API

**Fixes**
- Fixed export sounding different from preview (was using FFmpeg on original file)
- Export now applies all effects identically to what you hear in preview

### v1.2.0 (2026-01-16)

**Stereo Processing**
- Added real-time stereo width control (0-200%) with M/S matrix processing
- Renamed "Center Bass" to "Mono Bass" for clarity
- Stereo width now previews live via Web Audio API

**Level Metering**
- Added stereo level meter with separate L/R channel analysis
- Peak hold display with configurable hold time
- Overload indicator for clipping detection

**UI Improvements**
- Removed unicode icons from settings card headers for cleaner look
- Updated grid layout to 5 columns to accommodate Stereo card
- Changed Stereo card badge from "Export Only" to "Live"

### v1.1.0 (2026-01-17)

**Major Refactor: Vite Build System**

- Migrated from vanilla JavaScript to Vite build system
- Replaced native FFmpeg (fluent-ffmpeg) with FFmpeg.wasm for browser-based processing
- Added proper ES Modules support with cross-origin isolation headers
- Improved development experience with hot module replacement
- Reduced app bundle size by eliminating native FFmpeg binary

**FFmpeg.wasm Integration**

- Using single-threaded core (`@ffmpeg/core-st`) - no SharedArrayBuffer requirement
- All FFmpeg files bundled locally (no CDN dependency at runtime)
- All FFmpeg audio filters available including crossfeed, stereotools, loudnorm
- Added 60-second timeout for FFmpeg loading (prevents infinite hang)
- Fixed Uint8Array handling for large file IPC transfers
- Added `worker-src 'self' blob:` to Content Security Policy

**Features**

- Added output presets (Streaming/Studio)
- Added "Show Tips" toggle in sidebar
- Improved audio player with seek bar and stop button
- Added FFmpeg processing cancellation (cancel button during export)
- Added "Export Only" badge to Center Bass feature

**Architecture Improvements**
- Created `audioConstants.js` with shared constants for audio parameters
- Grouped global state into organized objects (`playerState`, `audioNodes`, `fileState`)
- Added settings validation layer with `SETTINGS_SCHEMA` and `validateSettings()`
- Fixed IPC listener accumulation in preload.js with proper listener tracking
- Fixed seek interval race condition with safety clears
- Added console warnings for loudness analysis failures (instead of silent null)
- Aligned harshness taming parameters between Web Audio (preview) and FFmpeg (export)
- Smoothed progress bar transitions (no more 5%→10% jump)
- Removed dead `previewDir` code

**Fixes**
- Fixed audio file loading via IPC for proper file:// protocol handling
- Fixed null reference errors in audio chain initialization

### v1.0.0 (Initial Release)
